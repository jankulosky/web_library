# Introduction 
The Web Library project is a book rental web application designed for librarians. 

It includes features such as adding new books, deleting books, modifying book entries, and marking books as rented. 

The project consists of a Spring Boot API, an H2 database for storing book and author information, and a React application for displaying and interacting with the data. 

The React application has a user-friendly interface with features like book listings, editing and deleting books, marking books as rented, and pagination for displaying books in sets of five.
